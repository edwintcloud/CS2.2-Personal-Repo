# Least Common Subsequence

Find the longest subsequence that is present in two given sequences in the same order. i.e. find a longest sequence which can be obtained from the first original sequence by deleting some items, and from the second original sequence by deleting other items.

Subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.

For example:

```python
Input:
X='ABCBDAB'
Y='BDCABA'

Output:
'The length of LCS is 4'
'LCS are BDAB, BCAB and BCBA'
```
